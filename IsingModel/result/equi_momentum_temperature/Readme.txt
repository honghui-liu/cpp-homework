(1) from the picture, we can clearly see a phase transition precess when temperature is close to 2.3, this is coherent to what the theoretica result.

(2) when computing, i also found that it would be really difficult to converge when temperature is close to the critical temperature (2.3).

(3) the original qti file (.qti) is also here.
