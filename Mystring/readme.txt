i have successfully reload the "+" operator of string under c language.

(1) the main method i used was to make use of the "=" oprator that has already been reload, then i reload the "+" operator between "Mystring" and "Mystring", the reload of "+" operator between different data types are based on this "+" operator and "=" operator;

(2) you can simply run the mystring.out (./mystring.out) file to check.
