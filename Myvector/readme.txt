the cpp files must be compiled under standard 11 and should be compiled together
(1) i have written a makefile in this dir, type "make" followed by "make clean", you can get a compilable file named myvector.out which actually is alrealy here.
(2) i have shown part of the functions of my defined class Myvector in main function which can be seen bu simply run the myvector.out file (./myvector.out)
(3) the class is defined in myvector.h file, and its functions are writen in myvector.cpp file.
