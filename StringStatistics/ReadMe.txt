(1) you can just run the "strstatic.out" file (./[].out) and the outcome will be shown on screen, and write out in the "out.txt" meantime. It will take some time (20 seconds may be) to finish (maybe my code is not that efficient), so please be patient;

(2)  the program has no argument input, so if you want to count another file's string, you need to adjust the input parameter in the .cpp file.

(3) the program can only count strings that are made up of upper case letters from A-J, it can be less, but no more!

(4) the outcome of counts will be printed on screen and write out to the "out.txt" file which you can see in this dir.
